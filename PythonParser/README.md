# Python Parser

This is a simple parser meant to illustrate the ability of ParsecCore to parse indentation sensitive grammars.
It is a parser of a simplified Python based on the version [3.0](https://docs.python.org/3.0/reference/index.html)
of Python. Version 3.0 is chosen since the grammar is the simplest and later versions add additional complexity to the
grammar outside of our example of parsing indentation.
